    """Embeds the pose of a 3D object PGA multivectors.

    The pose is given by a position and a orientation quaternion. The latter is assumed to follow
    the pybullet conventions: to be given in Hamilton convention, where ijk = -1, and with the
    scalar component last (ijkw order).

    The embedding contains three plane multivectors v_i with
    ```
    v_i = T(p) R(q) e_i reverse(T(p) R(q))
    ```
    where `T()` is the translation embedding, `R()` is the rotation embedding, and `e_i` are the PGA
    basis vectors.

    If `explicit_point`, then a fourth multivector represents the position itself.
