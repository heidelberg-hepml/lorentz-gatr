    """Embeds 3D rotations in multivectors.

    We follow the convention used in Leo Dorst, "A Guided Tour to the Plane-Based Geometric Algebra
    PGA", and map rotations around the origin to bivectors.

    For quaternions we use the "Hamilton" convention, where ijk = -1 (*not* the JPL convention
    where ijk = 1). For details, see "Why and How to Avoid the Flipped Quaternion Multiplication"
    by Sommer et al. (2018)
