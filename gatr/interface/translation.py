    Parameters
    ----------
    multivector : torch.Tensor with shape (..., 16)
        Multivector.
    divide_by_embedding_dim : bool
        Whether to divice by the embedding dim. Proper PGA etiquette would have us do this, but it
        may not be good for NN training.
    threshold : float
        Minimum value of the additional, unphysical component. Necessary to avoid exploding values
        or NaNs when this unphysical component of the homogeneous coordinates becomes small.

    Returns
    -------
    translation : torch.Tensor with shape (..., 3)
        3D components of the translation vector.
